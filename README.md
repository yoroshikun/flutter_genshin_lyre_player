## Flutter Genshin Lyre Auto Player

A native flutter implementation of a midi to genshin lyre player. With a fully functional UI and no pre-requisits or coding experience required.

## How to use

1. Download the latest release from the releases tab (.exe)
2. Run the program in administrator mode (this is required for consistent keyboard controls)
3. Open the .mid file you would like to player
4. Adjust the settings as you preffer
5. Click play to start playback (please ensure you are in the genshin window when playback starts)

> The UI will get better with time, I had to rush to put it all together

### Contributing

This project was hastily written with flutter and dart, if you want to contribute your knowledge please do so! I am still very new to OOP and flutter and would love feedback and contributions from the community.
