### Contributing

This project was hastily written with flutter and dart, if you want to contribute your knowledge please do so! I am still very new to OOP and flutter and would love feedback and contributions from the community.

#### Development setup

Fork and pull down this repo and follow the steps below :)

The flutter SDK is required and installation instructions are [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

To develop in this repo with your own flutter setup you must first enable desktop compiling.

```bash
flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
```

> You can develop this app with other operating systems such as macosx and linux however many features require the windows API to work such as the file_picker and keypressing

It is highly recommended that you download the flutter dev tools for your IDE of choice to assist with developing
